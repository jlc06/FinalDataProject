# FinalDataProject
Finally bootcamp project
Final project kickoff
Round Three of The Open
Cam Smith is Champion Golfer of The Year
Fourth and final commit
Initial tools for web scraping and cleaning will be python, pandas and jupyter notebook
Machine learning tools will be scikit learn
Database tools we use are SQL and PostgreSQL
Additional database tools to be used are SQLAlchemy and AWS
Exploratory analysis tools will be R Studio
Dashboard and visualizations will be presented using Tableau
Presentation notes: We used a wide range of tools for each part of our process. For the web scraping, cleaning, and data manipulation we using Python and Pandas in Jupyter Notebooks.
Presentation notes 2:  To create our database, we took the CSV files created using Python/Pandas and imputed them into SQL created tables in pgAdmin. We connected to AWS to create our database and used SQLAlchemy to directly inject our database into our model using SQL query language.
Presentation notes 3: We used R Studio for some occasional exploratory analysis and to create our initial visualizations.
Presentation notes 4: We used Scikit learn within our Jupyter Notebooks to create our machine learning model. 
Presentation notes 5: And finally, we using Tableau to create our final dashboard and revamped our visualizations originally created in R Studio. 
That's a wrap on the class and project
