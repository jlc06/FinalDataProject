We came to the decision to use a linear regression model instead of using binary classifiers given the continuous data inputs and outputs we were expecting. We did not change our model choice through the course of the project


Originally for our variables, we used basic stats to create our model and test the accuracy. We tried simply passing yards per game, rush attempts and yards per game, receiving yards per game and a few other stats such as targets and attempts per game. This resulted in accuracy of roughly 45-57% among the 4 models. So clear room for improvement in our next attempt.
