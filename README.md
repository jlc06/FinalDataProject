# NFL Football Predictions
## Overview
- 1. Selected Topic: Predicting 2022 Fantasy Football Outcomes
- 2. Reasoning: All five members of our team are sports fans and we were deciding between predicting what cities would most likely receive a professional sports team in a hypothetical relocation and predicting future sports outcomes at a player level. Upon further review, we felt that predicting future performances at the player level had more ample data to train a model with and we could achieve more reliable data insights. Naturally, given the popularity of fantasy football we felt predicting 2022 NFL player outcomes would be both a fun and fulfilling project to jump into. 
- 3. Source Data: Most, if not all, of our data will be providing through web scapes of Pro-Football-Reference, a website where statistics are presented in tabular form and have an easy to access API. 
- 4. Questions:
    - What variables carry the most weight in predicting a player's fantasy football performance?
    - Can a future season be predicted using a previous seasons statistics?
    - What will the final fantasy football rankings be for the 2022 season?

## Visualization
We will be using Tableau to visualize the story our data tells. So far we have a table showing the relationship between the predicted stats and the actual stats and a graph showing the difference in predicted vs. actual stats broken down by position. We will be adding a final graph showing what the model predicts for next year based on last year's stats.

We hope to use our class time efficiently to accomplish a lot of our team-oriented work given our conflicting schedules, but we stay in constant contact via slack
